This is Massive, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). It's a slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and uses some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)

Demo images* courtesy of Pexels, a fantastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
you can use it for pretty much whatever.
